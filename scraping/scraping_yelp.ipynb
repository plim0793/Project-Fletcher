The typical Tesora would have been nice but I left exploring for somewhere else. I decided to stray from Castro St, and walk down 18th. That's when I encountered this gem. I noticed people chillin' in the vine draped patio area, drinking cappuccinos or having a late afternoon hot meal. Although this place appears to be primarily a coffee shop, it has a few hot dining options as well. Which is a bit hit or miss because when I'm having coffee, I don't really want the whiff of mustard. Cool vibe inside--mellow acoustic guitar in the background, the patio greenery flowing inside, industrial looking grey concrete flooring, a long white bench with soft cushions, and most curiously wall-to-wall light brown wooden tiling which extended across the ceiling. In a way, it felt as though the ceiling and floor should be reversed. The trippy black and white tiling all across the counter added a nice contrast to the overwhelming wood theme. A bit on the loud side (with the typical inane chatter in the background), and the lighting is dim, so I'd say it's a place that's better for catching up with friends than working on anything requiring your focus. I ordered the latte and chocolate chip cookie. The latte was satisfying, smooth medium blend. The chocolate chip cookie was thick, with salt pieces on top; also satisfying. Overall, not a bad choice if you're looking to find a unique spot to meet up with a friend on a Saturday afternoon.\"),\n",

Their egg is on top of the sandwich! They also have brûlée grapefruit which was super refreshing and topped with candied kumquat (amazing!!). Definitely my go to spot in SF\"),\n",

The cold brews were great - not too acidic. The avocado toast had good bread and the egg was also cooked nicely. I don't even like eggs normally, but my friend insisted on protein and toast to nurse my hangover. My friend's yogurt was super filling - big bowl with lots of granola and fruit. Also sheep's milk yogurt is used and is very good.Great ambiance - super chill baristas, crowd of people, and fun music. People were here doing work, catching up with friends, or just grabbing coffee on the go. Will be back for sure!\"),\n",

I also got the black iced tea which was great for the warm days in SF. I've also gotten the prosciutto and poached egg, bruleed grapefruit, and the cheddar biscuit. I'll definitely say I'm in love with a biscuit. \\xa0Delicious food and very enjoyable. \\xa0People are nice and a great area to hang out (inside or out) and grab some great food.

We checked Yelp and this was the closest coffee shop with character we could get in Castro area. Then...deception...one person per table not even consuming a drink and occupying the space with their tablets. Horrible situation and metaphor of the online connected/out of line disconnection with other people. And then we heard a voice. \"Do you want to sit here, I gave you my table\", murmured a soft spoken Chinese from NY just transplanted to SF. At this point, the rest of the coffee shoppers were like asleep in front of their devices, so un-romantic. Honestly, Reveille..reveille-toi! this should be a place to gather, drink, chit and chat, not an extension of your work stuff. Anyways, coffee was awesome and all nicely designed, plus guess what? We became friend of this gentle guy who invited me to go next week to see the awesome views from his Jackson Towers apartment (check my review and get jealous:).Now that I think twice...this does not even seem a review for Reveille Coffee Co, but it is. I had a good time there, a nice drink, and the beginning of new great experiences. Keep it up and sack those who have roots in those chairs (without consuming).'),\n",

The interior reminds me of say, if Urban Outfitters had a coffee shop. It looks like it takes place in a garage under a house and has a very clean and cool feel to it. My friend I was with got their regular cup of house coffee while I opted for the mocha. I don't think their mocha is for everyone because it's not really sweet but more rich in chocolate, but it was just fine for me. It seems that this is another popular spot for coffee, as barely any seating was available. They also serve cafe food here such as sandwiches and salads which is a plus. I wish this kind of coffee wasn't expensive, but if I had the right budget I would probably come here often.Next time, I'm going to try the dirty chai!\"),\n",
