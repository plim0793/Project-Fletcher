Think fava bean purée on sliced baguettes with fresh lemon, olive oil, sea salt and tuna (or was it sardines? I dunno but it was filling and delicious), big chia bowls with dried fruit, nuts and fresh strawberries and bananas, almond smoothies with dates and cocoa, waffles, fresh juices with ginger and other yummy flavors, Portuguese style snack plates, fig toast with ricotta and honey, avocado toasts, etc. The staff is genuinely friendly and intelligent, the iced tea has me going for hours, good lighting, newspapers, and magazines!\n",

This morning I made it a point to see if they were open and to my surprise they were and there was no line. I ordered a latte (they don't have sweeteners) and a muffin..... it was about $7 total. I thought that was a bit steep since the coffee cups are small.... it was be a \"tall\" at Starbucks. My latte was delicious, it didn't need sweetener or anything else.
